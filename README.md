# Digitalalarmclock
With the concepts of sequential and combinational circuits, this digital alarm clock is built utilising simple logic gates, counters, shift registers, and 7‐segment displays. The alarm’s final output is coupled to a buzzer that indicates the alarm and has a snooze button implemented with inbuilt delay modules.
